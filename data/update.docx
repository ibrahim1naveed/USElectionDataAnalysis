I extracted 170 posts for the subreddits r/politics and r/conservative. However, new and hot both were giving identical data, so on of the team members needs to either run it on their code to check if they get the same problem.
If that is the case, then most likely we will just get 333 posts for each subreddit from the sub-class "Hot".
